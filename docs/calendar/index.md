# Calendar

***`wovoui`***'s custom `<Calendar>` component generates a WAI-ARIA compliant calendar style date selection widget,
which can be used to control other components, or can be used to create customized date picker inputs.

## Overview

`<Calendar>` is WAI-ARIA accessibility compliant, optimized for keyboard control (arrow, page up/down, home, and end
keys). Internationalization is also supported, and default's to the browser's or page's locale, if no locale(s) are
specified.
