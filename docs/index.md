# Introduction

[wovoui](https://github.com/wovosoft/wovoui) is a vuejs based components library. It is made on
top of [Bootstrap 5's](https://getbootstrap.com/) designs. The JavaScript functionality
of Bootstrap is done by [Vuejs](https://v3.vuejs.org/). Some extra components are added
to the library too.

This library is highly inspired by [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/),
which is a really awesome component library.
